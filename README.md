research-scripts
===================

This repository holds all scripts created during my master degree course. It basically contains files written in python language (v.2.7.6) for performing tweet classification.

Module Dependencies:
--------------------

If you are working on you own computer (a linux based machine), run the following commands to get the latest packages for all dependencies:

>* pip install -U numpy
>* pip install -U scipy
>* pip install -U scikit-learn
>* pip install -U matplotlib
>* pip install -U tabulate
>* pip install -U nltk
>* pip install -U pylab
>* pip install -U enchant

Quick Start
--------------------

To quick start the project, run Setup.py making sure that all other source folders are detectable by python core. The script will train and print classification reports for the target classifier.
