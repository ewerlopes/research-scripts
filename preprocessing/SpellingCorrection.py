# # Replacing repeating characters (as done by replaceReptCharacter fuction in Pre_Util.py
# # is actually an extreme form of spelling correction. This script takes on the less extreme 
# # case of correcting minor spelling issues using Enchantâ€” a spelling correction API. This script
# # was built from "Python text processing with NLTK" book, page 36.
# # Dependencies: 'Enchant' <http://www.abisource.com/projects/enchant/>
# #               'aspell' (a good open source spellchecker and dictionary) <http://aspell.net/>
# #               'pyenchant' library <http://www.rfk.id.au/software/pyenchant/>.
